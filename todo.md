# Todo List

- Zellij into actual files
  - keybinds! (through ALT only so it doesn't mess with everything else)

- nvim
  - tab stuff (have menu appear but only change tab after hitting enter)

- Seperate Configs for Each Host
  - Ideally as much as I can in Flake.nix
  - Make Configs simple
  - Specific options for each Host as well

- Hypr configuration

- Make script for direnv + flake setup
